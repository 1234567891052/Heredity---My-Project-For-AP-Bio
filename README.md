# Heredity---My-Project-For-AP-Bio
Here I will be creating a simple JavaScript project, where I will be trying to recreate the monohybrid cross! 

In this project I will be creating the monohybrid cross that I learnt from my biology class. The monohybrid cross is used in genetics. To learn more about it, you can use this link: https://biologydictionary.net/monohybrid-cross/#:~:text=A%20monohybrid%20cross%20is%20a,for%20a%20certain%20genetic%20trait.
